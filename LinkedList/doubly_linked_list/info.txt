This is a Doubly Linked List (DLL) implementation in Python.

Each node stores three things:
1. data – the value of the node
2. next – the address of the next node
3. prev – the address of the previous node

The DoublyLinkedList class provides functions to:

1. append(data) – add a node at the end.
2. prepend(data) – add a node at the beginning.
3. delete(data) – remove a node that matches a given value.
4. display() – print all nodes from start to end.

The main difference from a singly linked list is that every node is linked
both forward (next) and backward (prev), allowing two-way traversal.
