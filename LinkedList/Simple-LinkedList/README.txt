This code creates a Singly Linked List in Python using two classes: Node and LinkedList.

Node class

The Node class is used to store individual elements (nodes) of the linked list.
Each node has two parts:

data: stores the actual value.

next: a reference (link) to the next node in the list.
Initially, next is set to None.

LinkedList class

This class manages the nodes and provides various functions to work with the list.

append(data)
Adds a new node at the end of the list.
If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head.
Otherwise, it goes to the end by looping until current.next is None.

display()
Prints all node values in order, separated by arrows (->).
It starts from head and moves forward until no nodes are left.

start(data)
Inserts a new node at the beginning of the list.
The new node’s next pointer is set to the current head, and then the head is updated to the new node.

del_first()
Deletes the first node by making the head point to the second node (self.head.next).

del_last()
Deletes the last node.
It loops until it reaches the second-last node (where current.next.next is None) and sets its next pointer to None.

insert_after(after, what)
Inserts a new node after a specific value.
It first searches for the node with data equal to after.
When found, it creates a new node, connects it to the next node, and then adjusts the previous node’s next pointer.

count()
Counts the total number of nodes in the list by looping through and increasing a counter until the end is reached.

exist(val)
Checks if a certain value exists in the list.
It loops through each node and compares the data.
If found, it prints “True”, otherwise “False”.

Flow of the main code

A LinkedList object is created.

Several nodes are added using append().

One node is added at the start using start().

The first and last nodes are deleted.

Nodes are inserted after specific values using insert_after().

The number of nodes is counted using count().

The list is displayed using display().

Finally, exist() checks whether a particular value is in the list.

Summary

This code demonstrates:

Node creation

Traversal through the list

Insertion and deletion (at start, end, and after a specific value)

Searching and counting nodes

It covers all core linked list operations and shows how pointers (next) are used to link and rearrange nodes dynamically.
