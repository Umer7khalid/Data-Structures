📘 Project: Stack Implementation in Python
📖 Description

This project demonstrates a simple Stack data structure built from scratch using Python lists.
It includes all essential stack operations — push, pop, and view — following the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.

⚙️ Features

Push elements to the top of the stack

Pop elements from the top

View the current top element

Handles empty stack cases safely

🧠 Core Concept

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO order — the last element added is the first one
