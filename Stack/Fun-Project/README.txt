🧮 README for Bracket Validation Using Stack
📘 Project: Bracket Validation (Balanced Parentheses Checker)
📖 Description

This project validates whether brackets in a given string are balanced using a custom Stack class.
It supports (), {}, and [] — and ensures that every opening bracket has a proper closing one in the correct order.

⚙️ Features

Checks for matching parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets

Detects mismatched or unbalanced expressions

Implements stack operations manually

Returns True if balanced, False otherwise

🧠 Core Concept

Uses the LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack principle:

Push opening brackets to the stack

Pop them when a matching closing bracket appears
